    "<p>This Master Subcontract Agreement is made and entered into by and between DC 2929, LLC, DBA TRANSBLUE TACOMA, P.O. BOX 81, MILTON, WA 98354, hereinafter called “CONTRACTOR,” and </p><p>Subcontractor / Supplier / Vendor:\t\tContact Person:\t</p><p>_____________________________________________\t\tOffice Phone:\t</p><p>Address:\t\t\tCell Phone:\t</p><p>\t\t\tFax:\t</p><p>hereinafter called “SUBCONTRACTOR.”</p><p>Contractor has or may utilize Subcontractor’s services of Subcontractor for various projects.  The parties desire to enter into a Master Subcontract Agreement (“MSA”) that will apply to and bind the parties with respect to all future projects for which Contractor contracts with Subcontractor.  The scope of work (“Work”) for projects governed by this MSA will be specified and authorized pursuant to a separately executed Work Order Authorization, which will specify the project name and address, name of the project owner, scope of work, contract price, and other information and terms applicable to the particular project (each project for which Contractor and Subcontractor enter into a Work Order Authorization is referred to herein as “Project”).  Unless the terms of the Work Order expressly states otherwise, the terms of this MSA are binding and applicable to all Work or Project(s) performed by Subcontractor.  </p><p></p><p>For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:  </p><p></p><p>1.\tNO EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.  By executing this MSA, Contractor does not guarantee or represent that it will subcontract with Subcontractor for any particular project(s).  Contractor reserves the right to competitively bid all projects.</p><p></p><p>2.\tWORK ORDER AUTHORIZATIONS.  Contractor, in its sole discretion, may issue a Work Order Authorization to Subcontractor for the performance of the Work on various projects.  Each Work Order Authorization will be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  Contractor retains the sole and exclusive discretion to issue or not issue a Work Order Authorization to Subcontractor.  The terms and conditions of this MSA are incorporated by reference into each Work Order Authorization issued by Contractor to Subcontractor and govern all Work performed by Subcontractor.  All work not included in a Work Order Authorization or this MSA must be approved (a) in writing; and (2) by Contractor’s assigned Project Manager prior to Subcontractor commencing any such work not included in the Work Order or this MSA.  Any work not approved as described above will not be paid for by Contractor.or by the project owner.  </p><p></p><p>3.\tSUBCONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES.  Subcontractor will furnish all labor, material, tools, equipment, services, supplies, and supervision necessary to complete the Work described in the Work Order Authorization in a proper and efficient manner in accordance with the drawings and specifications, all applicable building codes (including, but not limited to, IBC, IRC, UMC, UPC, CABO and NEC), and all applicable Federal, State, County, and City laws, ordinances, statutes, rules, and regulations, particularly those relating to wages, hours, fair employment practices, nondiscrimination, safety and working conditions required by any government authority for the Work.  Subcontractor’s workmanship must be first class and represent the highest quality standards of the trade.  All materials furnished by Subcontractor must be of good quality, new unless otherwise agreed in writing, and free from fault and defect.  </p><p></p><p>\tPrior to commencing the Work or any portion of it, Subcontractor is responsible for thoroughly inspecting the work by others in the area where Subcontractor will perform its Work and must notify Contractor in writing of all deficiencies in others’ work and all conditions which might adversely affect the Work prior to Subcontractor commencing its Work.  Failure to notify Contractor in writing of such deficiencies and conditions within forty-eight (48) hours after discovery waives Subcontractor’s right to any additional compensation or extension of time arising out of such deficiencies or conditions and constitutes Subcontractor’s admission that the previously completed work was completed in a proper manner.  Failure by Subcontractor to discover or report such defects or discrepancies constitutes a waiver of any claims by Subcontractor against Contractor for the recovery of any costs, expenses, or damages resulting therefrom.  </p><p></p><p>3.1\tPrime Contract.  If there is a prime contract for the Work or Project, Subcontractor acknowledges that copies of the prime contract between project owner and Contractor are on file in the office of Contractor and are available to and have been examined and accepted by Subcontractor.  That prime contract is incorporated in this MSA by reference.  Subcontractor agrees to be bound to Contractor by the terms of the prime contract, and to assume toward Contractor all obligations and responsibilities that the Contractor assumes toward the project owner in addition to the requirements of this MSA.  In the case of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this MSA and the prime contract, this MSA controls.</p><p></p><p>4.\tSCHEDULE.  Subcontractor will commence and perform the Work no later than the date identified in the applicable Work Order Authorization and proceed in a prompt and diligent manner and at such time as such work, or any part of it, becomes available, or at such other time or times as Contractor may direct, so as to promote the general progress of the entire project.  Subcontractor will not, by delay or otherwise, interfere with or hinder the work of Contractor or any other subcontractor(s).  Any materials that are to be furnished by Subcontractor under the MSA or any Work Order Authorization must be furnished in sufficient time to enable Subcontractor to perform and complete the Work within the time or times provided.  Subcontractor agrees to comply with the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations and perform the Work to the full and complete satisfaction of Contractor and project owner. Subcontractor will cooperate and coordinate with Contractor and other subcontractors.  Subcontractor acknowledges that time is of the essence in this MSA.  It is agreed that no extension of time to the MSA or Work Order Authorization will be allowed without the prior written consent of Contractor.</p><p></p><p>In the event Subcontractor fails to furnish the materials and/or perform the Work within the requirements of Contractor’s schedule, Subcontractor will take such steps as may be necessary to improve Subcontractor’s progress.  This includes, but is not limited to, increasing the number of shifts and/or overtime operations; days of work; and/or the manpower, equipment, and tools being utilized.  Contractor may require Subcontractor to submit a supplementary schedule or schedules as may be necessary to demonstrate the manner in which Subcontractor will not impede the progress of the overall project, all without additional cost to Contractor or project owner.    Upon written request by Contractor, Subcontractor will furnish to Contractor such evidence as Contractor may require relating to Subcontractor’s ability to fully perform the Work in the manner and within the time specified herein.</p><p></p><p>5.\tLOWER-TIER SUBCONTRACTORS.  [Reserved] </p><p></p><p>6.\tPAYMENT.  Subcontractor must submit to Contractor applications for payment at such reasonable times as requested by Contractor to enable Contractor to timely apply for and obtain payment from project owner.  Within forty-five (45) days after Contractor receives payment for the work performed by Subcontract, and except as otherwise set forth herein, Contractor will pay Subcontractor per the rates agreed in the applicable Work Order Authorization; provided, however, that Contractor will have no obligation to pay Subcontractor for any Work performed or materials or equipment furnished under this MSA and applicable Work Order Authorization(s) until Contractor has been paid for such Work, materials, and equipment by project owner.  Subcontractor expressly agrees to bear the risk of project owner’s non-payment.  If Contractor receives payment from project owner for less than the full value of materials delivered to the site, but not yet incorporated into the work, the amount due to Subcontractor on account of such materials delivered to the site will be proportionately reduced.  </p><p></p><p>If Subcontractor is indebted to Contractor or anyone else for labor, fringe benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, rental, or other proper charges against the work covered by this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, the amount of such indebtedness may be deducted by Contractor from any payment or payments made under this provision and Contractor may pay such deducted amounts directly to the party to whom Subcontractor is indebted.  Provided, further, that Contractor may from time to time require, and Subcontractor will promptly provide, a statement in writing setting forth what amounts, if any, are due or payable by Subcontractor to third parties for labor, fringe benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, rental or other proper changes in connection with, or arising out of the performance of this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.  Subcontractor agrees to pay its obligations, including taxes and labor fringe benefits, promptly as they become due.  Contractor may withhold from any payment, progress or final, otherwise due under this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, such sums as Contractor reasonably may determine are necessary to secure and protect Contractor or project owner from claims or liens that may be asserted by said third parties and any costs or expenses arising in connection with the legal settlement thereof, including attorneys’ fees; at its discretion, Contractor may pay such withheld sums directly to the third party to whom such amounts are due and payable.  Subcontractor hereby agrees that in the event any lien is filed against a project on account of the Work, Contractor will have the right to settle or otherwise resolve said lien claims directly.  Subcontractor will promptly reimburse Contractor for any such settlement or other lien claim resolution in the event such resolution exceeds the amount due Subcontractor.</p><p></p><p>No payment whatsoever, whether progress or final, will be paid to Subcontractor until the following conditions precedent have been met to Contractor’s satisfaction:  (a) Contractor has received payment from project owner; (b) MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization(s) are returned to Contractor fully executed; (c) Subcontractor furnishes Contractor with acceptable Certificates of Insurance applicable to the Work evidencing all required coverage and additional insureds named; (d) Subcontractor furnishes Contractor with all required compliance paperwork, completed and acceptable, applicable to Subcontractor and any lower-tier subcontractors; (e) Subcontractor furnishes Contractor with satisfactory evidence that all obligations incurred by Subcontractor pursuant to this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations which may be the basis for a lien against the premises, have been paid in full; (f) Subcontractor furnishes, in a form satisfactory to Contractor, releases and waivers of liens and claims on behalf of itself and its lower-tier subcontractors, suppliers and lower-tier suppliers for their completed work and/or supply of materials; (g) Subcontractor furnishes, releases and/or certificates from such governmental agencies as Contractor may require; (h) Subcontractor is in compliance with the project schedule; and (i) Subcontractor is not in material breach of its obligations under the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.  Contractor and Subcontractor expressly agree that the foregoing and project owner’s payment to Contractor for Subcontractor’s account are absolute conditions precedent to Contractor’s obligations to make progress or final payment to Subcontractor under this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.</p><p></p><p>No payment to Subcontractor constitutes an approval or acceptance of the Work, or materials furnished, or compliance with the requirements of the MSA or any applicable Work Order Authorization.  Subcontractor will remain liable for complete performance of the Work following receipt of any payment.  It is agreed that all progress payments will be deemed advances and are subject to adjustment at any time prior to final payment for errors, overpayments, claims, damages, defective work or Contractor’s good faith determination that the remaining balance of payments may be insufficient to insure completion of the Work in accordance with the terms for Contractor to pay lien, retention, or bond claims.    </p><p></p><p>Subcontractor agrees that any dispute that it may have regarding the amount of any progress payment must be communicated to Contractor in writing within fifteen (15) days after Subcontractor’s receipt of progress payment from Contractor.  If Subcontractor fails to notify Contractor within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any progress payment, it will be conclusively presumed that such progress payment was accurate and in full accordance with the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, and Subcontractor will be prohibited and barred from making any claim against Contractor for additional amounts.  </p><p></p><p>Final payment for work performed by Subcontractor will be made within forty-five (45) days (or a shorter time period as provided by law) after the later of (1) project owner acceptance of the Work; (2) Contractor receipt of final payment from project owner; and (3) Subcontractor providing all required job closeout documents as required by the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, including releases and waivers of liens; which are absolute conditions precedent to Contractor’s obligation to make final payment to Subcontractor under this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.  Unless specifically reserved in writing, acceptance of final payment by Subcontractor constitutes a release of all claims by Subcontractor.</p><p></p><p>7.\tWITHHOLDING PAYMENT.  In addition to the provisions of Section 6 herein regarding the conditions which must be met prior to Subcontractor being entitled to payment, Contractor may withhold any amount otherwise payable under the MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization, in whole or in part, if:  (a) any claim arising out of or connected with the Work or Subcontractor’s performance under the MSA or any Work Order Authorization is threatened or filed against Subcontractor by Contractor or if there is a reasonable basis for belief that any such claim against Subcontractor may be filed; (b) any claim for which Contractor is to be reimbursed or indemnified by Subcontractor under the MSA or any Work Order Authorization is filed against Contractor or if reasonable evidence indicates the probability of the filing of any such claim; (c) any claim or lien related to the performance of the Work, any lower-tier subcontractor or supplier of labor, equipment, or materials used in connection with the Work is threatened or filed against Contractor, against the Project, against any other property of property owner, or against Contractor’s bond, or if reasonable evidence indicates the probability of the filing of any such claim; (d) Subcontractor is in default under any provision of the MSA or any Work Order Authorization; (e) Contractor reasonably doubts that the Work can be completed within the time specified in the MSA, any Work Order Authorization, or the Project construction schedule; or for the then unpaid balance of the price under any Work Order Authorization; or (f) any monies are due Contractor by Subcontractor on any other contract. </p><p></p><p>8.\tCHANGE ORDERS.  Contractor may, without invalidating this MSA or applicable Work Order Authorizations, reserve the right to add, deduct, delete, alter or change the Work during construction by means of a Change Order which will modify the Work Order Authorization.  Change Orders must be in writing and signed by the parties.  Subcontractor will not commence any extra work or make claims related to extra work unless Contractor has executed a Change Order for that work.  </p><p></p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for adjustment of the Work Order Authorization price or time under this Section 8 must be made in writing within forty-eight (48) hours from the date such changes are ordered.  Subcontractor’s failure to provide timely written notice constitutes a waiver of Subcontractor’s claim for adjustment.  If any change or alteration in the Work pursuant to a Work Order Authorization is made by which the amount of the Work to be done is decreased, or if the whole or any portion thereof be disposed with, no compensation will be paid to Subcontractor for any loss of anticipated profits.  Subcontractor also acknowledges that, unless expressly stated otherwise within a written Change Order, any change in the Work Order Authorization effected through a written Change Order constitute full and final agreement with regard to all costs incurred, labor performed, materials and equipment furnished, and any delay, acceleration, or loss of efficiency associated with the change in the Work. </p><p></p><p>9.  \tCLAIMS (EXTRA WORK, CHANGES, DELAYS).  Subcontractor must provide written notice to Contractor within forty-eight (48) hours after the occurrence of any event giving rise to a claim by Subcontractor or, if the prime contract provides for a shorter period, within sufficient time to allow Contractor to give notice to project owner (whichever is sooner), including but not limited to, interruptions, extra work, additional work, changed work, delay, hindrances, and/or inefficiency loss(es) of any nature whatsoever in the Work.   Failure by Subcontractor to provide notice as required by this Section constitutes an absolute waiver of any claim of Subcontractor, including those for additional costs or additional time and arising in any way from, or caused by, the occurrence.  Contractor does not waive the requirement for timely written notice unless Contractor’s waiver is unequivocal, explicit, and in writing.  </p><p></p><p>In the event Subcontractor’s performance of the MSA or any Work Order Authorization is delayed, extra costs are incurred, or the Work is interfered with, Subcontractor may request an extension of the time as herein provided, but will not be entitled to any additional compensation, except to the extent that Contractor may, on behalf of Subcontractor, recover from project owner for such delays less any markups or costs incurred by Contractor.  Subcontractor will accept such recovery, if any, as fully discharging the Contractor with respect to such claims.  Subcontractor agrees that Contractor will not, under any circumstances, be liable for Subcontractor’s delays when said delays were caused by the project owner or third parties. Subcontractor will proceed diligently with the Work, pending a final determination pursuant to any dispute clause herein or pursuant to any other action taken with respect to a claim or claims.</p><p></p><p>Subcontractor will have full responsibility for the preparation and presentation of any claim presented through Contractor to project owner and will bear all expenses thereof, including attorneys’ fees.  This Section will survive the completion or termination of the MSA and any Work Order Authorization.</p><p></p><p>10. \tDISPUTES.  Contractor and Subcontractor agree that the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington will have exclusive jurisdiction over all claims, disputes, or other controversies relating to the Work, this MSA, or any Work Order Authorization that are not pass-through claims to project owner.  The parties hereto agree that the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to all of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in the matter.</p><p></p><p>In the event of any dispute or claim between Contractor and project owner which directly or indirectly involves the work performed or to be performed by Subcontractor, or in the event of any dispute or claim between Contractor and Subcontractor caused by or arising out of conduct for which project owner may be responsible, Subcontractor agrees to be bound to Contractor and Contractor agrees to be bound to Subcontractor to the same extent that Contractor is bound to project owner by the terms of the prime contract and by any and all procedures and resulting decisions, findings, determinations, or awards made thereunder by the person so authorized in the prime contract, or by an administrative agency, board, court of competent jurisdiction or arbitration.  If any dispute or claim of Subcontractor is prosecuted or defended by Contractor together with disputes or claims of Contractor’s own, and Subcontractor is not directly a party, Subcontractor agrees to cooperate fully with Contractor and to furnish all documents, statements, witnesses, and other information required by Contractor for such purpose and will pay or reimburse Contractor for all expenses and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection therewith, to the extent of Subcontractor’s interest in such claim or dispute.    </p><p></p><p>11.\tPERMITS, LICENSES, TAXES, FEES.  Subcontractor will secure and pay for all permits, fees, licenses, tests, and inspections necessary for the performance of the Work pursuant to this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations and will pay any and all Federal, State and Local taxes, including but not limited to any applicable Sales and/or Use taxes, applicable to the Work.  Subcontractor will be aware of all Local, State, and Federal permit and regulatory requirements related to the performance of the Work.  Subcontractor expressly agrees to abide by and adhere to all said requirements.  Subcontractor will give notices to applicable authorities having jurisdiction as required for the inspection of the Work.  Subcontractor will request, coordinate, and attend all required inspections.  Subcontractor will timely provide written copies to Contractor of all permits, licenses, and agency correspondence.  Subcontractor will keep Contractor reasonably and timely informed as to the progress of obtaining said permits, fees and licenses.  If Subcontractor performs the Work in a manner contrary to laws, statutes, ordinances, or regulations, Subcontractor will assume full responsibility for such Work and will bear the attributable costs, including but not limited to, civil fines, court costs, and attorneys’ fees of Contractor.</p><p></p><p>12.\tASSIGNMENT.  Subcontractor will not assign any portion of this MSA or any Work Order Authorization or any of Subcontractor’s rights, causes of action, claims, or any other interest arising out of this MSA or any Work Order Authorization without the prior express written consent of Contractor.  Subcontractor agrees that this prohibition on assigning any of its interest in the MSA and any Work Order Authorization expressly includes any legal remedies or causes of action it may have arising out of the Work, the MSA and any Work Order Authorization, unless Contractor gives its prior express written consent.  Any assignment or purported assignment without such written approval will be null and void.</p><p></p><p>13.  \tMATERIALS.  Materials delivered by or for Subcontractor and intended to be incorporated into the construction hereunder will remain on the job site and will become property of project owner upon payment, but Subcontractor may remove any surplus remaining at the completion of the Work, unless otherwise stated in the prime contract. It will be Subcontractor’s responsibility to unload, store, secure, and protect its materials, and Subcontractor will bear the risk of loss thereof, and will protect such materials against loss until actually incorporated into the Work and until the Work is accepted, even though title thereto may previously have passed to project owner under the preceding provisions, except that Subcontractor will not bear any such loss as may be due to the fault of Contractor or project owner.  All scaffolding, apparatus, ways, works, machinery and plants brought upon the premises by Subcontractor will remain its property, but in case of Subcontractor’s inability to perform, and Contractor’s completion of the Work, Contractor will be entitled to use the said scaffolding apparatus, ways, works, machinery and plant without cost or liability for depreciation or damage by use and without prejudice to Contractor’s other rights or remedies for any damage or loss sustained by reason of said inability.</p><p></p><p>14.\tWARRANTY.  Subcontractor hereby guarantees and warrants that all work and/or materials provided under this MSA and any Work Order Authorization will be of good quality and workmanship, free from faults and defects, and in conformance with the terms and provisions of the MSA and applicable Work Order Authorization(s).  Contractor is relying upon Subcontractor’s special skill and judgment to furnish suitable materials and/or services.  Subcontractor further agrees to make good, without cost to project owner or Contractor, any and all defects due to imperfect workmanship or materials, which may appear during a reasonable time, but not less than one (1) year from the date of final acceptance (as that term is defined in the prime contract) of the Project by project owner, or within such additional warranty period as may be provided for in this MSA, any Work Order Authorization, or in the prime contract, whichever is longer.  Subcontractor will be bound by the provisions of the prime contract and applicable law with respect to warranty of the Work.  The obligations of this Section will survive the completion or termination of this MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization.</p><p></p><p>15.  \tCORRECTION OF THE WORK.  If project owner or Contractor rejects any portion of the Work, or if the Work is not in conformance with the terms and provisions of the MSA and applicable Work Order Authorization(s), Subcontractor will promptly correct the Work.  Subcontractor will be responsible for the cost of correcting such work, any additional testing, inspections, and compensation for services and expenses of project owner and/or Contractor made necessary by the defective Work.  If Subcontractor’s correction or removal of Work destroys or damages completed or partially completed work or property of project owner, Contractor or any third party, Subcontractor will be responsible for the cost of correcting such destroyed or damaged construction.</p><p></p><p>16.\tTAKEOVER/SUSPENSION/TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.  Subcontractor will commence and at all times carry on, perform, and complete the Work to the full and complete satisfaction of Contractor, project owner, and their designated representatives.

All of the costs, including reasonable overhead, profit and attorneys’ fees, incurred by Contractor in arranging and performing the Work will be charged to Subcontractor, and Contractor will have the right to deduct such expenses from monies due or to become due Subcontractor.  Subcontractor will be liable for the payment of any expenses incurred in excess of the unpaid balance of the Work Order Authorization price.</p><p></p><p>In the event of an emergency involving risk of loss or injury to person or property, arising prior to an actual takeover, Contractor may take appropriate action to mitigate such emergency without notice to Subcontractor and may charge Subcontractor for all costs incurred in such mitigation.  Previous demands made on Subcontractor not followed by a takeover will not be deemed a waiver of Contractor’s right to do so.  </p><p></p><p>In the event project owner, for any cause other than Contractor’s default, temporarily suspends work under the prime contract, Contractor may order Subcontractor to suspend work under any applicable Work Order Authorization.  Subcontractor will not be entitled to any additional compensation or damage for such suspensions, except, and only to the same extent, Contractor receives additional compensation from project owner under the provisions of the prime contract for work covered by such Work Order Authorization.</p><p></p><p>17. \tUNIT PRICE.

Unit prices include the total amount due to Subcontractor for the actual quantity, including, but not limited to, mark up for overhead and profit.</p><p></p><p>18.  \tMATERIAL QUALITY.  Materials condemned by Contractor and/or project owner as failing to conform to the prime contract, worked or not, will upon notice from Contractor be immediately removed by Subcontractor.

Subcontractor acknowledges that the prompt and complete performance of all punch list work is a material and important part of the Work.  The Work will be deemed complete only after Subcontractor has satisfactorily completed all punch list work and has completed all other aspects of the Work, including the delivery of all submittals and other information, as required by Contractor.</p><p></p><p>20.  \tJOB DAMAGE.  Job damage caused by Subcontractor, its lower-tier subcontractor or supplier of any tier, to work other than its own will be reported immediately to Contractor and Subcontractor will be responsible for its repair and the related cost.

In the event Subcontractor fails to maintain any insurance required by this MSA and applicable Work Order Authorizations in force during the entire life of the applicable Work Order Authorization, Contractor may, at its option, purchase such insurance in the name of Subcontractor and deduct the cost of same from payments due Subcontractor.  Any policy providing coverage required under this Section will be maintained from the start of the Work through completion of the Work and at all times thereafter while corrective work is in process.  Policy limits will be provided in amounts not less than the following:</p><p></p><p>\tWorkers’ Compensation Coverage\tStatutory</p><p>\tFederal Acts Coverage (if applicable)\tStatutory</p><p>\t\t</p><p>Employers’ Liability Coverage</p><p>\t\tEach Accident\t$1,000,000  \t\t\t</p><p>\t\tDisease – Each Employee\t$1,000,000   </p><p>\t\tDisease – Policy\t$1,000,000   </p><p></p><p>23.

Such Certificates will show that Contractor has been named as additional insured on the General Liability Policy (and excess liability policy, if any), and that such policies provide primary coverage with respect to Contractor and project owner.  In addition, such Certificates will provide Contractor with forty-five (45) days’ notice in case of cancellation or non-renewal.</p><p></p><p>23.5\tPROPERTY INSURANCE [Reserved]</p><p></p><p>23.6\tWAIVER OF SUBROGATION.  Subcontractor will, at its sole cost and expense, include in its insurance policies (except for Professional Liability) appropriate clauses pursuant to which the insurance companies:  (a) waive all right of subrogation against Contractor with respect to losses payable under such policies; and (b) agree that such policies will not be invalidated if, prior to a loss, the insured waives, in writing, any or all rights of recovery against any party for losses covered by such policies.

Subcontractor will furnish to Contractor upon demand evidence satisfactory to Contractor establishing the inclusion of the above clauses in Subcontractor’s insurance policies.</p><p></p><p>Subcontractor will furnish any bonds, security or deposits required by such authority to permit performance of the Work.

Contractor assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representations made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of the MSA or any applicable Work Order Authorization, unless the understandings or representations by Contractor are expressly stated in this MSA or any applicable Work Order Authorization.

Subcontractor, in addition to its obligation to provide insurance under the MSA, agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Contractor and its officers, agents employees, directors, successors, assigns, affiliates, subsidiaries, servants, and representatives (hereinafter “Indemnitees”) harmless from any and all claims for damages, demands, losses, expenses, and liabilities to or by third parties, including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and all costs of litigation arising from, resulting from, or connected with the Work including, but not limited to, services performed or to be performed and materials and equipment furnished under the MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization by Subcontractor or Subcontractor’s agents, employees, lower-tier subcontractors and suppliers, even though such claims may prove to be false, groundless, or fraudulent, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the limitations provided below.</p><p></p><p>Subcontractor’s duty to defend and indemnify Indemnitees will not apply to liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of any of the Indemnitees.</p><p></p><p>Subcontractor’s duty to defend and indemnify Indemnitees for any and all liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the negligence of Subcontractor or its agents, employees, lower-tier subcontractors and suppliers, in whole or in part, including concurrent negligence of a) any of the Indemnitees, and b) Subcontractor or its agents, employees, lower-tier subcontractors and suppliers, will apply only to the extent of negligence of Subcontractor or its agents, employees, lower-tier subcontractors and suppliers.

All materials furnished by Subcontractor must be of good quality, new unless otherwise agreed in writing, and free from fault and defect.  \\n\\n\\n\\tPrior to commencing the Work or any portion of it, Subcontractor is responsible for thoroughly inspecting the work by others in the area where Subcontractor will perform its Work and must notify Contractor in writing of all deficiencies in others’ work and all conditions which might adversely affect the Work prior to Subcontractor commencing its Work.  Failure to notify Contractor in writing of such deficiencies and conditions within forty-eight (48) hours after discovery waives Subcontractor’s right to any additional compensation or extension of time arising out of such deficiencies or conditions and constitutes Subcontractor’s admission that the previously completed work was completed in a proper manner.  Failure by Subcontractor to discover or report such defects or discrepancies constitutes a waiver of any claims by Subcontractor against Contractor for the recovery of any costs, expenses, or damages resulting therefrom.  \\n\\n\\n3.1\\tPrime Contract.  If there is a prime contract for the Work or Project, Subcontractor acknowledges that copies of the prime contract between project owner and Contractor are on file in the office of Contractor and are available to and have been examined and accepted by Subcontractor.  That prime contract is incorporated in this MSA by reference.  Subcontractor agrees to be bound to Contractor by the terms of the prime contract, and to assume toward Contractor all obligations and responsibilities that the Contractor assumes toward the project owner in addition to the requirements of this MSA.  In the case of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this MSA and the prime contract, this MSA controls.\\n\\n\\n4.\\tSCHEDULE.  Subcontractor will commence and perform the Work no later than the date identified in the applicable Work Order Authorization and proceed in a prompt and diligent manner and at such time as such work, or any part of it, becomes available, or at such other time or times as Contractor may direct, so as to promote the general progress of the entire project.  Subcontractor will not, by delay or otherwise, interfere with or hinder the work of Contractor or any other subcontractor(s).  Any materials that are to be furnished by Subcontractor under the MSA or any Work Order Authorization must be furnished in sufficient time to enable Subcontractor to perform and complete the Work within the time or times provided.  Subcontractor agrees to comply with the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations and perform the Work to the full and complete satisfaction of Contractor and project owner. Subcontractor will cooperate and coordinate with Contractor and other subcontractors.  Subcontractor acknowledges that time is of the essence in this MSA.  It is agreed that no extension of time to the MSA or Work Order Authorization will be allowed without the prior written consent of Contractor.\\n\\n\\nIn the event Subcontractor fails to furnish the materials and/or perform the Work within the requirements of Contractor’s schedule, Subcontractor will take such steps as may be necessary to improve Subcontractor’s progress.  This includes, but is not limited to, increasing the number of shifts and/or overtime operations; days of work; and/or the manpower, equipment, and tools being utilized.  Contractor may require Subcontractor to submit a supplementary schedule or schedules as may be necessary to demonstrate the manner in which Subcontractor will not impede the progress of the overall project, all without additional cost to Contractor or project owner.    Upon written request by Contractor, Subcontractor will furnish to Contractor such evidence as Contractor may require relating to Subcontractor’s ability to fully perform the Work in the manner and within the time specified herein.\\n\\n\\n5.\\tLOWER-TIER SUBCONTRACTORS.  [Reserved] \\n\\n\\n6.\\tPAYMENT.  Subcontractor must submit to Contractor applications for payment at such reasonable times as requested by Contractor to enable Contractor to timely apply for and obtain payment from project owner.  Within forty-five (45) days after Contractor receives payment for the work performed by Subcontract, and except as otherwise set forth herein, Contractor will pay Subcontractor per the rates agreed in the applicable Work Order Authorization; provided, however, that Contractor will have no obligation to pay Subcontractor for any Work performed or materials or equipment furnished under this MSA and applicable Work Order Authorization(s) until Contractor has been paid for such Work, materials, and equipment by project owner.  Subcontractor expressly agrees to bear the risk of project owner’s non-payment.  If Contractor receives payment from project owner for less than the full value of materials delivered to the site, but not yet incorporated into the work, the amount due to Subcontractor on account of such materials delivered to the site will be proportionately reduced.  \\n\\n\\nIf Subcontractor is indebted to Contractor or anyone else for labor, fringe benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, rental, or other proper charges against the work covered by this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, the amount of such indebtedness may be deducted by Contractor from any payment or payments made under this provision and Contractor may pay such deducted amounts directly to the party to whom Subcontractor is indebted.  Provided, further, that Contractor may from time to time require, and Subcontractor will promptly provide, a statement in writing setting forth what amounts, if any, are due or payable by Subcontractor to third parties for labor, fringe benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, rental or other proper changes in connection with, or arising out of the performance of this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.  Subcontractor agrees to pay its obligations, including taxes and labor fringe benefits, promptly as they become due.  Contractor may withhold from any payment, progress or final, otherwise due under this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, such sums as Contractor reasonably may determine are necessary to secure and protect Contractor or project owner from claims or liens that may be asserted by said third parties and any costs or expenses arising in connection with the legal settlement thereof, including attorneys’ fees; at its discretion, Contractor may pay such withheld sums directly to the third party to whom such amounts are due and payable.  Subcontractor hereby agrees that in the event any lien is filed against a project on account of the Work, Contractor will have the right to settle or otherwise resolve said lien claims directly.  Subcontractor will promptly reimburse Contractor for any such settlement or other lien claim resolution in the event such resolution exceeds the amount due Subcontractor.\\n\\n\\nNo payment whatsoever, whether progress or final, will be paid to Subcontractor until the following conditions precedent have been met to Contractor’s satisfaction:  (a) Contractor has received payment from project owner; (b) MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization(s) are returned to Contractor fully executed; (c) Subcontractor furnishes Contractor with acceptable Certificates of Insurance applicable to the Work evidencing all required coverage and additional insureds named; (d) Subcontractor furnishes Contractor with all required compliance paperwork, completed and acceptable, applicable to Subcontractor and any lower-tier subcontractors; (e) Subcontractor furnishes Contractor with satisfactory evidence that all obligations incurred by Subcontractor pursuant to this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations which may be the basis for a lien against the premises, have been paid in full; (f) Subcontractor furnishes, in a form satisfactory to Contractor, releases and waivers of liens and claims on behalf of itself and its lower-tier subcontractors, suppliers and lower-tier suppliers for their completed work and/or supply of materials; (g) Subcontractor furnishes, releases and/or certificates from such governmental agencies as Contractor may require; (h) Subcontractor is in compliance with the project schedule; and (i) Subcontractor is not in material breach of its obligations under the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.  Contractor and Subcontractor expressly agree that the foregoing and project owner’s payment to Contractor for Subcontractor’s account are absolute conditions precedent to Contractor’s obligations to make progress or final payment to Subcontractor under this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.\\n\\n\\nNo payment to Subcontractor constitutes an approval or acceptance of the Work, or materials furnished, or compliance with the requirements of the MSA or any applicable Work Order Authorization.  Subcontractor will remain liable for complete performance of the Work following receipt of any payment.  It is agreed that all progress payments will be deemed advances and are subject to adjustment at any time prior to final payment for errors, overpayments, claims, damages, defective work or Contractor’s good faith determination that the remaining balance of payments may be insufficient to insure completion of the Work in accordance with the terms for Contractor to pay lien, retention, or bond claims.    \\n\\n\\nSubcontractor agrees that any dispute that it may have regarding the amount of any progress payment must be communicated to Contractor in writing within fifteen (15) days after Subcontractor’s receipt of progress payment from Contractor.  If Subcontractor fails to notify Contractor within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any progress payment, it will be conclusively presumed that such progress payment was accurate and in full accordance with the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, and Subcontractor will be prohibited and barred from making any claim against Contractor for additional amounts.  \\n\\n\\nFinal payment for work performed by Subcontractor will be made within forty-five (45) days (or a shorter time period as provided by law) after the later of (1) project owner acceptance of the Work; (2) Contractor receipt of final payment from project owner; and (3) Subcontractor providing all required job closeout documents as required by the MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations, including releases and waivers of liens; which are absolute conditions precedent to Contractor’s obligation to make final payment to Subcontractor under this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations.  Unless specifically reserved in writing, acceptance of final payment by Subcontractor constitutes a release of all claims by Subcontractor.\\n\\n\\n7.\\tWITHHOLDING PAYMENT.  In addition to the provisions of Section 6 herein regarding the conditions which must be met prior to Subcontractor being entitled to payment, Contractor may withhold any amount otherwise payable under the MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization, in whole or in part, if:  (a) any claim arising out of or connected with the Work or Subcontractor’s performance under the MSA or any Work Order Authorization is threatened or filed against Subcontractor by Contractor or if there is a reasonable basis for belief that any such claim against Subcontractor may be filed; (b) any claim for which Contractor is to be reimbursed or indemnified by Subcontractor under the MSA or any Work Order Authorization is filed against Contractor or if reasonable evidence indicates the probability of the filing of any such claim; (c) any claim or lien related to the performance of the Work, any lower-tier subcontractor or supplier of labor, equipment, or materials used in connection with the Work is threatened or filed against Contractor, against the Project, against any other property of property owner, or against Contractor’s bond, or if reasonable evidence indicates the probability of the filing of any such claim; (d) Subcontractor is in default under any provision of the MSA or any Work Order Authorization; (e) Contractor reasonably doubts that the Work can be completed within the time specified in the MSA, any Work Order Authorization, or the Project construction schedule; or for the then unpaid balance of the price under any Work Order Authorization; or (f) any monies are due Contractor by Subcontractor on any other contract. \\n\\n\\n8.\\tCHANGE ORDERS.  Contractor may, without invalidating this MSA or applicable Work Order Authorizations, reserve the right to add, deduct, delete, alter or change the Work during construction by means of a Change Order which will modify the Work Order Authorization.  Change Orders must be in writing and signed by the parties.  Subcontractor will not commence any extra work or make claims related to extra work unless Contractor has executed a Change Order for that work.  \\n\\n\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any claim for adjustment of the Work Order Authorization price or time under this Section 8 must be made in writing within forty-eight (48) hours from the date such changes are ordered.  Subcontractor’s failure to provide timely written notice constitutes a waiver of Subcontractor’s claim for adjustment.  If any change or alteration in the Work pursuant to a Work Order Authorization is made by which the amount of the Work to be done is decreased, or if the whole or any portion thereof be disposed with, no compensation will be paid to Subcontractor for any loss of anticipated profits.  Subcontractor also acknowledges that, unless expressly stated otherwise within a written Change Order, any change in the Work Order Authorization effected through a written Change Order constitute full and final agreement with regard to all costs incurred, labor performed, materials and equipment furnished, and any delay, acceleration, or loss of efficiency associated with the change in the Work. \\n\\n\\n9.  \\tCLAIMS (EXTRA WORK, CHANGES, DELAYS).  Subcontractor must provide written notice to Contractor within forty-eight (48) hours after the occurrence of any event giving rise to a claim by Subcontractor or, if the prime contract provides for a shorter period, within sufficient time to allow Contractor to give notice to project owner (whichever is sooner), including but not limited to, interruptions, extra work, additional work, changed work, delay, hindrances, and/or inefficiency loss(es) of any nature whatsoever in the Work.   Failure by Subcontractor to provide notice as required by this Section constitutes an absolute waiver of any claim of Subcontractor, including those for additional costs or additional time and arising in any way from, or caused by, the occurrence.  Contractor does not waive the requirement for timely written notice unless Contractor’s waiver is unequivocal, explicit, and in writing.  \\n\\n\\nIn the event Subcontractor’s performance of the MSA or any Work Order Authorization is delayed, extra costs are incurred, or the Work is interfered with, Subcontractor may request an extension of the time as herein provided, but will not be entitled to any additional compensation, except to the extent that Contractor may, on behalf of Subcontractor, recover from project owner for such delays less any markups or costs incurred by Contractor.  Subcontractor will accept such recovery, if any, as fully discharging the Contractor with respect to such claims.  Subcontractor agrees that Contractor will not, under any circumstances, be liable for Subcontractor’s delays when said delays were caused by the project owner or third parties. Subcontractor will proceed diligently with the Work, pending a final determination pursuant to any dispute clause herein or pursuant to any other action taken with respect to a claim or claims.\\n\\n\\nSubcontractor will have full responsibility for the preparation and presentation of any claim presented through Contractor to project owner and will bear all expenses thereof, including attorneys’ fees.  This Section will survive the completion or termination of the MSA and any Work Order Authorization.\\n\\n\\n10. \\tDISPUTES.  Contractor and Subcontractor agree that the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington will have exclusive jurisdiction over all claims, disputes, or other controversies relating to the Work, this MSA, or any Work Order Authorization that are not pass-through claims to project owner.  The parties hereto agree that the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to all of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in the matter.\\n\\n\\nIn the event of any dispute or claim between Contractor and project owner which directly or indirectly involves the work performed or to be performed by Subcontractor, or in the event of any dispute or claim between Contractor and Subcontractor caused by or arising out of conduct for which project owner may be responsible, Subcontractor agrees to be bound to Contractor and Contractor agrees to be bound to Subcontractor to the same extent that Contractor is bound to project owner by the terms of the prime contract and by any and all procedures and resulting decisions, findings, determinations, or awards made thereunder by the person so authorized in the prime contract, or by an administrative agency, board, court of competent jurisdiction or arbitration.  If any dispute or claim of Subcontractor is prosecuted or defended by Contractor together with disputes or claims of Contractor’s own, and Subcontractor is not directly a party, Subcontractor agrees to cooperate fully with Contractor and to furnish all documents, statements, witnesses, and other information required by Contractor for such purpose and will pay or reimburse Contractor for all expenses and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection therewith, to the extent of Subcontractor’s interest in such claim or dispute.    \\n\\n\\n11.\\tPERMITS, LICENSES, TAXES, FEES.  Subcontractor will secure and pay for all permits, fees, licenses, tests, and inspections necessary for the performance of the Work pursuant to this MSA and all applicable Work Order Authorizations and will pay any and all Federal, State and Local taxes, including but not limited to any applicable Sales and/or Use taxes, applicable to the Work.  Subcontractor will be aware of all Local, State, and Federal permit and regulatory requirements related to the performance of the Work.  Subcontractor expressly agrees to abide by and adhere to all said requirements.  Subcontractor will give notices to applicable authorities having jurisdiction as required for the inspection of the Work.  Subcontractor will request, coordinate, and attend all required inspections.  Subcontractor will timely provide written copies to Contractor of all permits, licenses, and agency correspondence.  Subcontractor will keep Contractor reasonably and timely informed as to the progress of obtaining said permits, fees and licenses.  If Subcontractor performs the Work in a manner contrary to laws, statutes, ordinances, or regulations, Subcontractor will assume full responsibility for such Work and will bear the attributable costs, including but not limited to, civil fines, court costs, and attorneys’ fees of Contractor.\\n\\n\\n12.\\tASSIGNMENT.  Subcontractor will not assign any portion of this MSA or any Work Order Authorization or any of Subcontractor’s rights, causes of action, claims, or any other interest arising out of this MSA or any Work Order Authorization without the prior express written consent of Contractor.  Subcontractor agrees that this prohibition on assigning any of its interest in the MSA and any Work Order Authorization expressly includes any legal remedies or causes of action it may have arising out of the Work, the MSA and any Work Order Authorization, unless Contractor gives its prior express written consent.  Any assignment or purported assignment without such written approval will be null and void.\\n\\n\\n13.  \\tMATERIALS.  Materials delivered by or for Subcontractor and intended to be incorporated into the construction hereunder will remain on the job site and will become property of project owner upon payment, but Subcontractor may remove any surplus remaining at the completion of the Work, unless otherwise stated in the prime contract. It will be Subcontractor’s responsibility to unload, store, secure, and protect its materials, and Subcontractor will bear the risk of loss thereof, and will protect such materials against loss until actually incorporated into the Work and until the Work is accepted, even though title thereto may previously have passed to project owner under the preceding provisions, except that Subcontractor will not bear any such loss as may be due to the fault of Contractor or project owner.  All scaffolding, apparatus, ways, works, machinery and plants brought upon the premises by Subcontractor will remain its property, but in case of Subcontractor’s inability to perform, and Contractor’s completion of the Work, Contractor will be entitled to use the said scaffolding apparatus, ways, works, machinery and plant without cost or liability for depreciation or damage by use and without prejudice to Contractor’s other rights or remedies for any damage or loss sustained by reason of said inability.\\n\\n\\n14.\\tWARRANTY.  Subcontractor hereby guarantees and warrants that all work and/or materials provided under this MSA and any Work Order Authorization will be of good quality and workmanship, free from faults and defects, and in conformance with the terms and provisions of the MSA and applicable Work Order Authorization(s).  Contractor is relying upon Subcontractor’s special skill and judgment to furnish suitable materials and/or services.  Subcontractor further agrees to make good, without cost to project owner or Contractor, any and all defects due to imperfect workmanship or materials, which may appear during a reasonable time, but not less than one (1) year from the date of final acceptance (as that term is defined in the prime contract) of the Project by project owner, or within such additional warranty period as may be provided for in this MSA, any Work Order Authorization, or in the prime contract, whichever is longer.  Subcontractor will be bound by the provisions of the prime contract and applicable law with respect to warranty of the Work.  The obligations of this Section will survive the completion or termination of this MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization.\\n\\n\\n15.  \\tCORRECTION OF THE WORK.  If project owner or Contractor rejects any portion of the Work, or if the Work is not in conformance with the terms and provisions of the MSA and applicable Work Order Authorization(s), Subcontractor will promptly correct the Work.  Subcontractor will be responsible for the cost of correcting such work, any additional testing, inspections, and compensation for services and expenses of project owner and/or Contractor made necessary by the defective Work.  If Subcontractor’s correction or removal of Work destroys or damages completed or partially completed work or property of project owner, Contractor or any third party, Subcontractor will be responsible for the cost of correcting such destroyed or damaged construction.\\n\\n\\n16.\\tTAKEOVER/SUSPENSION/TERMINATION FOR CAUSE.  Subcontractor will commence and at all times carry on, perform, and complete the Work to the full and complete satisfaction of Contractor, project owner, and their designated representatives.  It is specifically understood and agreed that in the event that Subcontractor refuses or fails to supply enough properly-skilled workers or materials to maintain the schedule of work, refuses or fails to make prompt payment to lower-tier subcontractors or suppliers of labor, materials or services, fails to correct, replace, or re-execute faulty or defective work done or materials furnished, disregards the law, ordinances, rules, regulations or orders of any public authority having jurisdiction, files for bankruptcy, or commits a material breach of this MSA or any Work Order Authorization, and fails to correct the default and maintain the corrected condition within three (3) business days of receipt of written notice of default, then Contractor, without prejudice to any rights or remedies otherwise available to it, will have the right to any or all of the following remedies:  (1) supply such number of workers and quantity of materials, equipment, and other facilities as Contractor deems necessary for the completion of the Work, or any part thereof, which Subcontractor has failed to complete or perform after the foregoing notice, and to charge the cost thereof to Subcontractor, who will be liable for the payment of same, including reasonable overhead and profit; (2) contract with one or more additional subcontractors to perform such part of the Work as Contractor will determine to provide prompt completion of the Work and the Project and charge the cost thereof to Subcontractor; (3) withhold payment of any monies due to or to become due Subcontractor pending corrective action to the extent required and to the satisfaction of Contractor; and (4) terminate the Work Order Authorization, using any materials, implements, equipment, appliances, or tools furnished or belonging to Subcontractor to complete the Work and furnish those materials, equipment, and/or employ such workers as Contractor deems necessary to maintain the orderly progress of the Work.  All of the costs, including reasonable overhead, profit and attorneys’ fees, incurred by Contractor in arranging and performing the Work will be charged to Subcontractor, and Contractor will have the right to deduct such expenses from monies due or to become due Subcontractor.  Subcontractor will be liable for the payment of any expenses incurred in excess of the unpaid balance of the Work Order Authorization price.\\n\\n\\nIn the event of an emergency involving risk of loss or injury to person or property, arising prior to an actual takeover, Contractor may take appropriate action to mitigate such emergency without notice to Subcontractor and may charge Subcontractor for all costs incurred in such mitigation.  Previous demands made on Subcontractor not followed by a takeover will not be deemed a waiver of Contractor’s right to do so.  \\n\\n\\nIn the event project owner, for any cause other than Contractor’s default, temporarily suspends work under the prime contract, Contractor may order Subcontractor to suspend work under any applicable Work Order Authorization.  Subcontractor will not be entitled to any additional compensation or damage for such suspensions, except, and only to the same extent, Contractor receives additional compensation from project owner under the provisions of the prime contract for work covered by such Work Order Authorization.\\n\\n\\n17. \\tUNIT PRICE.  In the event the applicable Work Order Authorization(s) contain unit priced items, it is understood and agreed that any quantities mentioned are approximate only and subject to change as required by the prime contract, and as ordered and directed by Contractor and/or project owner.  Unit prices include the total amount due to Subcontractor for the actual quantity, including, but not limited to, mark up for overhead and profit.\\n\\n\\n18.  \\tMATERIAL QUALITY.  Materials condemned by Contractor and/or project owner as failing to conform to the prime contract, worked or not, will upon notice from Contractor be immediately removed by Subcontractor.  Failure of Contractor and/or project owner to immediately condemn any work or materials as installed will not in any way waive Contractor’s or project owner’s right to object thereto at any subsequent time.\\n\\n\\n19.  \\tPUNCH LIST WORK.  Subcontractor acknowledges that the prompt and complete performance of all punch list work is a material and important part of the Work.  The Work will be deemed complete only after Subcontractor has satisfactorily completed all punch list work and has completed all other aspects of the Work, including the delivery of all submittals and other information, as required by Contractor.\\n\\n\\n20.  \\tJOB DAMAGE.  Job damage caused by Subcontractor, its lower-tier subcontractor or supplier of any tier, to work other than its own will be reported immediately to Contractor and Subcontractor will be responsible for its repair and the related cost.

Prior to starting the Work, Subcontractor will procure, pay for, and maintain Workers’ Compensation Insurance, including Employer’s Liability, as may be required by the jurisdictions in which the Work is being performed.  Where applicable, this will include United States Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers Act Insurance including Coverage B Maritime – Employers Liability (including Jones Act) with limits not less than the Bodily Injury limits required by the prime contract, but in no event less than $1,000,000.  Subcontractor will provide for not less than forty-five (45) days’ notice to Contractor of cancellation or reduction of coverage. In the event Subcontractor fails to maintain any insurance required by this MSA and applicable Work Order Authorizations in force during the entire life of the applicable Work Order Authorization, Contractor may, at its option, purchase such insurance in the name of Subcontractor and deduct the cost of same from payments due Subcontractor.  Any policy providing coverage required under this Section will be maintained from the start of the Work through completion of the Work and at all times thereafter while corrective work is in process.  Policy limits will be provided in amounts not less than the following:\\n\\n\\n\\tWorkers’ Compensation Coverage\\tStatutory\\n\\tFederal Acts Coverage (if applicable)\\tStatutory\\n\\n\\nEmployers’ Liability Coverage\\n\\t\\tEach Accident\\t$1,000,000  \\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tDisease – Each Employee\\t$1,000,000   \\n\\t\\tDisease – Policy\\t$1,000,000   \\n\\n\\n23.  INSURANCE.  Subcontractor will obtain and keep in force during the term of this MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization, Commercial General Liability Insurance with coverage equal to, or greater than, the minimum specified in the prime contract and not less than the amount noted in this MSA.

Such Certificates will show that Contractor has been named as additional insured on the General Liability Policy (and excess liability policy, if any), and that such policies provide primary coverage with respect to Contractor and project owner.  In addition, such Certificates will provide Contractor with forty-five (45) days’ notice in case of cancellation or non-renewal.\\n\\n\\n23.5\\tPROPERTY INSURANCE [Reserved]\\n\\n\\n23.6\\tWAIVER OF SUBROGATION.  Subcontractor will, at its sole cost and expense, include in its insurance policies (except for Professional Liability) appropriate clauses pursuant to which the insurance companies:  (a) waive all right of subrogation against Contractor with respect to losses payable under such policies; and (b) agree that such policies will not be invalidated if, prior to a loss, the insured waives, in writing, any or all rights of recovery against any party for losses covered by such policies.

Subcontractor will furnish to Contractor upon demand evidence satisfactory to Contractor establishing the inclusion of the above clauses in Subcontractor’s insurance policies.\\n\\n\\nSubcontractor will furnish any bonds, security or deposits required by such authority to permit performance of the Work.  Subcontractor specifically agrees that it is familiar with and will comply with the current provisions of the Occupational Safety & Health Act of 1970, Public Law 91-596, 84 Stat. 1590 (OSHA), and the Washington State Industrial Safety & Health Act, RCW 49.17, et seq. (WISHA), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, if applicable.  Where these requirements apply, Subcontractor and all lower-tier subcontractors will file with Contractor with an executed Statement of Intent to pay Prevailing Wage form as required by applicable law before Subcontractor is entitled to receive any payment from Contractor; Subcontractor and all lower-tier subcontractors will keep accurate payroll records for the greater of (1) three (3) years from acceptance of the Work by project owner or (2) the minimum time period provided by applicable law or regulation. \\n\\n\\n24. \\tOTHER CONTRACTS.  It is understood and agreed that the Work may only constitute part of the work being performed for project owner by Contractor and other subcontractors.  Subcontractor, therefore, agrees to perform the Work in such a manner that it will not damage, injure, or delay any other work performed by Contractor or any other subcontractor, and further agrees to pay Contractor for any damage or delay that may be caused to such other work by Subcontractor or by Subcontractor’s agents or employees.\\n\\n\\n25.  \\tPRIOR UNDERSTANDINGS OR REPRESENTATIONS.  Contractor assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representations made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of the MSA or any applicable Work Order Authorization, unless the understandings or representations by Contractor are expressly stated in this MSA or any applicable Work Order Authorization.  It is expressly agreed that this MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization is a total statement and integration of the agreement between the parties.\\n\\n\\n26.\\tMODIFICATIONS.  No modification of this MSA or any applicable Work Order Authorization and no waiver of any rights under this MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization will be valid or binding on the parties unless in writing.  Failure of Contractor to insist upon strict performance of the MSA and any applicable Work Order Authorization, or to exercise any option herein conferred in any one or more instances will not waive any such rights, or any other covenants or agreements, but the same will be and remain in full force and effect. \\n\\n\\n27.  \\tHOUSEKEEPING.  Subcontractor will regularly and promptly, at its own expense, remove all refuse, waste, and debris produced by its operation.  Contractor will not provide a dumpster for Subcontractor’s use.  Refuse will not be permitted to accumulate to the extent that it interferes with free access to the Project site or creates a safety hazard.  Avoidance of safety hazards through good housekeeping is an important part of Subcontractor’s obligations.

In no event will Contractor be liable to Subcontractor for any other costs or amounts, including but not limited to consequential damages, loss of anticipated profits or unabsorbed overhead, on account of such termination, and Subcontractor hereby expressly waives any claims for such damages.  Termination will not relieve Subcontractor from its obligations in connection with Work performed prior to termination, nor will it relieve Subcontractor from its obligations under any provisions herein related to resolution of disputes.\\n\\n\\n33.\\tINDEMNIFICATION.

Further, the indemnification obligation herein will not be limited in any way by any limitation on the amount or type of damages, compensation or benefits payable to or for any third party under workers’ compensation acts, disability benefits acts, or other employee benefits acts; provided Subcontractor’s waiver of immunity by the provisions of this Section extends only to claims against Subcontractor by any of Indemnitees, and does not include, or extend to, any claims by Subcontractor’s employees directly against Subcontractor.\\n\\n\\nSubcontractor’s duty to defend is independent of its duty to indemnify.  Subcontractor agrees to defend Indemnitees regardless of whether its duty to indemnify is disputed.  If the allegations raised in the claim, lawsuit, or demand by any party against any of the Indemnitees, allege the claim arose in whole or in part by acts or omissions of the Subcontractor, Subcontractor agrees to defend Indemnitees.

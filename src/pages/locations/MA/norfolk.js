    "<p>This Master Subcontract Agreement is made and entered this \tday of _ \tby and between JRDasilva Inc. DBA Transblue Norfolk (hereinafter called “WE,” “OUR,” or “US”) and</p><p>Bond Registration #    \t</p><p>(hereinafter called “YOU” or “YOUR”).</p><p>We have or may utilize Your services for various projects. The parties desire to enter into a Master Subcontract Agreement (“MSA”) that applies to all projects We contract with You, including any current projects in process. The actual work (“Work”) for each project governed by this MSA will be specified and authorized pursuant to a separately executed Scope of Work (“SOW”) that specifies:</p><p>(a)\tthe project name and address,</p><p>(b)\tname of the project owner,</p><p>(c)\twork to be performed,</p><p>(d)\tcontract price or rates, and</p><p>(e)\tother information and terms applicable to that particular project.</p><p>(All work with a SOW is referred to herein as a “Project”). Unless the terms of the SOW expressly state otherwise, the terms of this MSA are binding and applicable to all Work or Project(s) You perform.</p><p></p><p>In this MSA, and in addition to other obligations, You will agree to the following:</p><p></p><p>1.\tYou receive payment after we receive payment. (¶3.1)</p><p>2.\tAll changes must be in writing signed by both parties. (¶4)</p><p>3.\tTime is of the essence. (¶5.3)</p><p></p><p>Now, therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:</p><p></p><p>1.\tPurpose. Unless expressly agreed otherwise, this MSA governs all future contracts or agreements between the parties. By executing this MSA, We do not guarantee or represent We will contract with You for a project or any particular project(s). We reserve the right to competitively bid all projects.</p><p> </p><p>2.\tRates and Scope of Work. We may, in our sole discretion, authorize You to perform Work on certain projects under a Scope of Work (“SOW”). Before authorization, the parties will agree on a contract rate or fixed price sum by Rate Confirmation Sheet substantially in the form of Exhibit A. Each SOW will be substantially in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto and incorporated by reference. We must approve, in writing, all work not included in a SOW or this MSA before you start any such work. Any work not so approved will not be paid for by Us or by the project owner.</p><p></p><p>3.\tPayment. You must submit payment applications per the terms of the SOW or within ten</p><p>(10) days of completing the Work if no time period is stated. Within forty-five (45) days after We receive payment for Your Work, and except as otherwise set forth herein, We will pay You per the rates agreed in the applicable SOW.</p><p></p><p>3.1\tPaid When Paid. We have no obligation to pay You for any Work performed, or materials or equipment furnished under this MSA or applicable SOW(s) until the project owner pays us the final payment for such Work, materials, or equipment. You expressly agree to bear the risk of project owner’s non-payment. If the project owner pays Us less than the full value of materials delivered to the site, or less than the full value of the Work performed, the amount You will be paid for such materials or Work will be proportionately reduced.</p><p></p><p>3.2\tProgress Payments.  All progress payments are considered advances and are subject to adjustment at any time prior to final payment for errors, overpayments, claims, damages, defective work, or to pay lien, retention, or bond claims. No payment constitutes an approval or acceptance of Your Work, the materials furnished, or Your compliance with the MSA or any applicable SOW. If you dispute the amount or timing of any progress payment, You must communicate this to Us, in writing, within fifteen (15) days after Your receipt of the progress payment, or it will be conclusively presumed that such progress payment was accurate and in full accordance with the MSA and all applicable SOWs. Further, You will be barred from making any claim against Us for additional amounts.</p><p></p><p>3.3\tOffsets. If You are indebted to Us or anyone else for labor, benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, or other charges against the Work, We may deduct that amount from payments due and pay such amounts directly to whom You are indebted. We may from time to time require, and You will promptly provide, a written statement setting forth Your debts to third parties for labor, benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, or other charges against the Work.

If the project owner pays Us less than the full value of materials delivered to the site, or less than the full value of the Work performed, the amount You will be paid for such materials or Work will be proportionately reduced.\\n\\n\\n3.2\\tProgress Payments.  All progress payments are considered advances and are subject to adjustment at any time prior to final payment for errors, overpayments, claims, damages, defective work, or to pay lien, retention, or bond claims. No payment constitutes an approval or acceptance of Your Work, the materials furnished, or Your compliance with the MSA or any applicable SOW. If you dispute the amount or timing of any progress payment, You must communicate this to Us, in writing, within fifteen (15) days after Your receipt of the progress payment, or it will be conclusively presumed that such progress payment was accurate and in full accordance with the MSA and all applicable SOWs. Further, You will be barred from making any claim against Us for additional amounts.\\n\\n\\n3.3\\tOffsets. If You are indebted to Us or anyone else for labor, benefits, taxes, supplies, materials, equipment, or other charges against the Work, We may deduct that amount from payments due and pay such amounts directly to whom You are indebted.

You hereby guarantee and warrant that all work and/or materials provided under this MSA and any SOW will be of first class quality and workmanship, free from faults and defects, and conforming to this MSA and applicable SOW(s).

You further agree to make good, without cost to project owner or Us, any and all defects due to imperfect workmanship or materials that appear within one (1) year from the date of final acceptance of the Project by project owner, or within such additional warranty period as may be provided for in this MSA, any SOW, or in the prime contract, whichever is longer.  This Section survives the completion or termination of this MSA and any applicable SOW.

If You or Your subcontractor or supplier damage the Work or Project in any way, that damage must be reported immediately.  In such case, You will be responsible for all repair and related costs. If we damage Your Work, we will immediately report this to You and We will be responsible for all repair and related costs.\\n\\n\\n5.9\\tProject Site and Safety. You will take all safety precautions necessary to perform the Work in a safe manner and to protect persons from illness, injury, or property damage arising out of the Work. In the event You do not promptly correct a safety violation, We may order You to stop work until the violation is corrected, and may correct the violation and charge all costs of compliance to You. You must promptly provide Us with written notice of safety hazard(s) or violation(s) found on the jobsite or of any injuries to Your subcontractors or suppliers incurred on the jobsite.\\n\\n\\nYou agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Us and project owner harmless from all claims, demands, proceedings, violations, penalties, assessments, or fines that arise out of or relate to Your failure to comply with any safety-related laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, or orders. This indemnity obligation will include all costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees We reasonably incur.\\n\\n\\n6.\\tInsurance.

Certificates of Insurance naming Us – as additional insured on the General Liability Policy (and excess liability policy, if any), and that such policies provide primary coverage with respect to Us and project owner must be on file before commencing the Work. In addition, such Certificates will provide Us with  thirty (30) days’ notice in case of cancellation or non-renewal.\\n\\n\\n6.2\\tWaiver of Subrogation. You will, at Your sole cost and expense, include appropriate clauses so the insurance companies: (a) waive all right of subrogation against Us with respect to losses payable under such policies; and (b) agree that such policies will not be invalidated if, prior to a loss, the insured waives, in writing, any or all rights of recovery against any party for losses covered by such policies.\\n\\n\\n6.3\\tBond & Regulations. You will furnish any bonds, security, or deposits required by such authority to permit performance of the Work. You and Your lower-tier subcontractors must be\\n\\n\\nregistered contractors, and licensed and bonded in the state where the Work is located and will maintain such registration, license and bond in full force and effect while contracted with Us or performing any Work. If applicable, You and all lower-tier subcontractors will file a Statement of Intent to pay Prevailing Wage form as required before receiving any payment. You and all lower-tier subcontractors will keep accurate payroll records as required by applicable law or regulation.\\n\\n\\n7.\\tIndemnification. In addition to Your obligation to provide insurance under the MSA, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Us and our officers, agents, employees, directors, successors, assigns, affiliates, subsidiaries, servants, and representatives (hereinafter “Indemnitees”) harmless from any and all claims for damages, demands, losses, expenses, and liabilities to or by third parties, including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and all costs of litigation arising from, resulting from, or connected with the Work. This duty extends to services performed or to be performed and materials and equipment furnished under the MSA and any applicable SOW by You or Your agents, employees, lower-tier subcontractors and suppliers, even though such claims may prove to be false, groundless, or fraudulent, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the limitations provided below. Your duty to defend and indemnify Indemnitees will not apply to liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of any of the Indemnitees.\\n\\n\\nYou specifically and expressly waive any immunity that may be granted under any Massachusetts or other applicable workers’ compensation act. Further, the indemnification obligation is not limited by amount or type of damages, compensation, or benefits payable to or for any third party under workers’ compensation acts, disability benefits acts, or other employee benefits acts.\\n\\n\\nYour duty to defend is independent of Your duty to indemnify. You agree to defend Indemnitees regardless of whether its duty to indemnify is disputed. Your duty to defend, indemnify, and hold the Indemnitees harmless will include, as to all claims, demands, losses and liability to which it applies, Indemnitees personnel-related costs, in-house expenses (including materials and labor, all reasonable fees (of attorneys and experts), court costs, and all other claim-related expenses. If a Court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction determines any indemnification provision is not enforceable, You agree to indemnify Indemnitees to the fullest extent permitted by law.\\n\\n\\n8.\\tDefault and Termination. You will commence and at all times carry on, perform, and complete the Work to the full and complete satisfaction of the project owner and Us. In addition to the obligations set forth in this MSA and applicable SOW, certain actions will constitute events of default that You may not have opportunity to cure.\\n\\n\\n8.1\\tDefault with No Ability to Cure. Unless You have Our written approval, You will be in default if You (a) contact the project owner, or its agents regarding anything other than Your access to the Project site; or You (b) fail to be on the Project site and perform the Work when scheduled. In such instances, We may terminate you immediately upon written notice or, in the alternative, and because our actual damages are difficult if not prohibitive to calculate, We may charge you liquidated damages of\\n$1,000.00 per day for any violation of this provision.\\n\\n\\n8.2\\tDefaults with Ability to Cure. The following constitute events of default if not cured within three (3) days of written notice:\\n\\n\\n(a)\\tYou refuse or fail to correct or replace faulty or defective work or materials furnished;\\n(b)\\tYou fail to promptly pay lower-tier subcontractors or material suppliers;\\n(c)\\tEither You or Your lower-tier subcontractors or suppliers place a lien on the Project;\\n(d)\\tYou disregard the laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, or orders of any public authority having jurisdiction;\\n\\n\\n(e)\\tYou file for bankruptcy protection or are subject to a receivership; or\\n(f)\\tYou commit a material breach of this MSA or any SOW.\\n\\n\\n8.3\\tOur Rights Upon Default. If You are in default, and in addition to the remedies in paragraph 8.1 above, we may, without prejudice to other rights or remedies:\\n\\n\\n(1)\\tsupply the subcontractors, workers, materials, equipment, or facilities We deem necessary to complete the Work, or any part thereof, and to charge You our cost (including reasonable overhead and profit);\\n(2)\\twithhold payment due You until We are satisfied You have corrected the Work; or\\n(3)\\tterminate the SOW and charge you for our cost (including reasonable overhead and profit) to secure new subcontractor(s), workers, materials, equipment, or facilities We deem necessary to complete the Work.\\n\\n\\nFurther, if We deem there is an emergency involving risk of injury to person or property arising prior to an actual takeover, We may take appropriate action to mitigate such emergency without notice to You and may charge You for all costs incurred in such mitigation.\\n\\n\\n8.\\tTermination for Convenience. We may, at our option, and at any time and for any reason, terminate this MSA and any applicable SOW as to all or any portion of the uncompleted Work. Upon your receipt of such a termination notice, You will immediately cease performance of the Work or such portions of the Work as We direct. Once we receive payment from the project owner for Your Work, We will pay You for that portion of the Work actually performed prior to termination, less payments already made and claims We have against You under this MSA or any applicable SOW. In no event will We be liable to You for any other costs or amounts, including but not limited to, consequential damages, loss of anticipated profits, or unabsorbed overhead and You expressly waive any claims for such damages. Termination does not relieve You from Your obligations concerning Work performed prior to termination, nor does it waive any other post-termination obligations herein including those concerning disputes.\\n\\n\\n9.\\tDisputes. You explicitly agree that this Agreement was entered into in  Norfolk County, Massachusetts and the Courts of Massachusetts, Norfolk County will have exclusive jurisdiction over all claims or disputes related to the Work, this MSA, or any SOW that are not pass-through claims to the project owner, unless You and We mutually agree in writing to binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association, Construction Industry Arbitration Rules, Boston, Massachusetts.

You will not assign any portion of this MSA, any SOW, or any of Your rights, causes of action, claims, or any other interest arising therefrom, including legal remedies or causes of action, without Our prior written consent. Any assignment or purported assignment without such written approval will be null and void.\\n\\n\\n11.\\tPrior Understandings or Representations. We assume no responsibility for any understanding or representation made prior to the execution of the MSA or any applicable SOW, unless expressly stated in this MSA or any applicable SOW. It is expressly agreed that this MSA and any applicable SOW is a total statement and integration of the agreement between the parties.\\n\\n\\n12.\\tModifications. No modification of this MSA or any applicable SOW and no waiver of any rights under this MSA and any applicable SOW will be valid or binding on the parties unless in writing. Our failure to insist upon strict performance of the MSA or any applicable SOW, or to exercise any option herein will not waive any such rights, covenants, or agreements, but all will remain in full force and effect.\\n13.\\tSeverability. If any paragraph, section, part, term, or provision of this MSA or any applicable SOW is construed or held to be unenforceable or void by order, decree, or judgment, the remaining paragraphs, sections, parts, terms, and provisions of this MSA and all applicable SOWs will not be affected thereby and will remain in full force and effect.\\n\\n\\n14.\\tSurvival. All indemnity, warranty, or insurance obligations continue as valid and enforceable obligations of the parties, notwithstanding any termination, cancellation, completion, or expiration of this MSA or appliable SOW.\\n\\n\\n15.\\tNotice. Any notice required in this Agreement must be hand-delivered, mailed, or emailed to Us, with a copy to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15.\\tVoluntary Agreement.
